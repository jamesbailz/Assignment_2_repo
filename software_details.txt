# Software Intention
The intention of this software is to demonstrate coding skills learnt in the GEOG5003M module
through a model that:
      1. Takes in data.
      2. Processes the data.
      3. Makes calculations based on the data.
      4. Displays the results on a GUI.
      5. Is controlled by a user through the GUI.
      6. Writes the results out to a file.
## Development Issues
The main issues during development of this model came through steps 1 and 2 of the above list.
When taking in the data, various white spaces appeared in the datasets which had to be 
manipulated before analysis could begin. Additionally, local Wi-Fi issues occured during this 
stage which meant the download code had to be commented out. This then had to be adapted after
the Wi-Fi issues were resolved as errors kept recurring. When completing data processing, 
values, lists and indexes became intertwined and in a way fused together. Detailed investigation 
of the datasets, defined lists and indexes was necessary to complete analysis. Much of this code
has been removed for aesthetic purposes.
### Software development process followed
The development process followed with this model was a very methodical, step-by-step process:
      1. Read in input data files adn write out to local files
      2. Clean up input files.
      3. Read in these files into lists of lists.
      4. Visualise the datasets using matplotlib.
      5. Identify areas of ice, storing the locations and values.
      6. Perform a series of calculations to find the mass of the ice.
      7. Determine if the iceberg can be towed.
      8. Write results out to a file.
      9. Re-visit above code and optimise
      The above was coded in a very basic way, with functions not being utilised as yet.
      10. Adapt read-in code into a function
      11. Initialise and GUI
      12. Adapt code from steps 3, 4, and 5 into functions for better integration with the GUI.
      13. Create a quit function to close the GUI once the user is finished with the model.
